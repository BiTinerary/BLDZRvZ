Set Windows Services To Default Startup:

This will set the Windows services to their default startup state. Special thanks to http://www.blackviper.com/ for having all the default information handy.

This will set the services startup by the "sc config" command and not by the registry.

To edit or view, all services and their startup are in the services_startup.txt in the files folder.
